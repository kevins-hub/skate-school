When I was growing up, skateboarding was not quite in its infancy, but mores its adolecense. It wasn't a cute new thing people on the outside saw and sought to understand. It actually had quite a bad rap. Skateboarders were juveniles who fought with security guards, smoked weed, and ditched school. But those were stereotypes set by a few extreme cases and pop culture. And they couldn't be more wrong. 

As the skaters of that time and their peers have grown up, the attitude towards skateboarding has become more.... understanding. Skateboarders aren't criminals, they never were. They just wanted to skate. Security guards, being skaters or friends of skaters during their childhoods, are friendlier to skateboarders and those skaters are friendly in return. Professional skateboarders can regularly be seen in mainstream media like Super Bowl ads. And the 2020 olympics will feature skateboarding as a sport for the first time in history.

Skateboarding at its core has always been a grind. No pun intended. It is a constant battle with your own ability, fear, and pain. But the rewards of those battles are unlike anything else. If you ask any skateboarder what it was like to land their first kick flip (if they ever landed one), they'll all describe it as one of the best and most rewarding feelings they've ever had. It's not like landing on a piece of wood after it flips under your feet is particularly gratifying to the senses. It's deeper than that. It is a culmination of months and months of practice, thousands of failed attempts, and probably a lot of self doubt. It's seeing your friends try and give up, and you having a goal and persevering to achieve it, while others decide the process is too long or hard for them. It's the realization that you can achieve difficult goals if you put in the work. Skateboarding has taught me many life lessons like this one. It has been invaluable in my success and my approach to success. Keep pushing. Keep skating.
